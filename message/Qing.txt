Hi Qing,

I just wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heartâ€”you were the very first person I spoke to when I joined QMA, and I honestly canâ€™t imagine what my rotation would have been like without you.

From day one, you made me feel so welcomed. I still remember how nervous I was stepping onto the trading floor for the first time, but your warmth and friendliness made everything feel a little less scary. Youâ€™ve been incredibly kind and patient with meâ€”always taking time to answer my questions, listening to me ramble, and offering encouragement whenever I was feeling anxious.

Youâ€™ve supported me in so many small but meaningful waysâ€”inviting me to lunch every day, checking in on how I was doing, and always making space for me to just be myself. I didnâ€™t expect to meet someone at work who would feel so easy to talk to, so safe to be around, and so genuinely caring. I feel really lucky that we got to spend this time together.

Thank you again for being such a steady presence through all the ups and downs. I hope we stay in touch, and I really hope we can keep eating lunch togetherâ€”even after I rotate ðŸ˜„

Warmly,
Annie
