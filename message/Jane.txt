**Subject:** Thank You (and wishing you a smooth recovery!)

Hi Jane,

I just wanted to say a big thank you for everything you’ve shared with me during my time here. I’ve learned so much from you, and I feel really lucky to have met you this summer.

I still remember when I first joined and was feeling really unsure about my project—I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to deliver anything meaningful. You were one of the first people who told me that what matters most is the attitude and the process, and that it's okay even if things don't work out perfectly. That conversation helped me calm down a lot and gave me the confidence to just focus and try my best.

I really appreciated how openly you shared your own experience interning at QMA, and how you went out of your way to make me feel included. Beyond that, I’ve been constantly impressed by your work—doing full-stack quant work, supporting the desk while also building tools, and just how proactive and capable you are. I still remember how smoothly you ran the team lunch—coordinating the restaurant, managing the orders—you made everything feel effortless, and I honestly found that so inspiring.

You’ve really become a role model for me. The way you carry yourself at work—both technically and interpersonally—is something I deeply admire. Thank you again for being so kind, thoughtful, and encouraging. You’ve had a really positive impact on me, and I’ll carry that with me moving forward.

Also, I hope your foot is healing up well—wishing you a smooth and speedy recovery!

Warmly,
Annie
