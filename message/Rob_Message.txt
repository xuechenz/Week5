Subject: Project Package and Thank You

Dear Robert,

Hope you are doing well! I wanted to send you a quick update on the current status of my project as I wrap up my rotation with QMA.

Project Status:

Feynman-Kac PDEs (Deep BSDE & DGM): For both Black-Scholes and SABR models, the networks are now stable and generate accurate results with short training times.

Fokker-Planck PDE (DGM): The Black-Scholes version is working well. The SABR model has stabilized, though training time remains long. I plan to continue fine-tuning over the weekend to further improve its efficiency and accuracy.

Presentation: I’m also continuing to refine my final presentation to ensure it’s well-prepared for the global QMA audience.

A short personal thank-you letter

Alongside the project materials, I’ve attached a brief letter of thanks—I wanted to take a moment to reflect on how much I’ve learned from you and how grateful I am for your support this summer.

Thank you again for the opportunity to work with you and the QMA team. It’s been a truly rewarding experience.
Wishing you a restful and enjoyable cruise vacation!

Warm regards,
Annie
