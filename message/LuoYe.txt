Hi Ye,

I just wanted to say thank you for all the guidance and insights you’ve shared with me during my time in QMA. Even though we didn’t work together closely day to day, I always felt that every conversation with you left me with something new to think about.

You consistently checked in on my project progress, asked thoughtful questions, and challenged me to consider things from a more practical, work-oriented perspective rather than just through a student lens. That shift in mindset has been really important for me, and I’m very grateful for the way you helped me see that.

I’ve also learned so much simply from hearing your thoughts—whether it was about technical topics, how to approach complex problems, or the connections between a brain teaser and American options (I still remember that one!). Your curiosity, depth of knowledge, and constant drive to understand things thoroughly is something I truly admire.

Thanks again for being so generous with your time and thoughts. I’ve taken away a lot from our interactions, and I really hope we stay in touch.

Best,
Annie
